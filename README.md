# ODIR: Seeing the Big Picture for Eye Health
In this project we are classifying various types of Eye Diseases that people get due to various reasons like age, diabetes, etc. These diseases are majorly classified into 4 categories namely Normal, cataract, Diabetic Retinopathy & Glaucoma. Deep-learning (DL) methods in artificial intelligence (AI) play a dominant role as high-performance classifiers in the detection of the Eye Diseases using images.
